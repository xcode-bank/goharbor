# Access and Search Project Logs

Harbor keeps a log of all of the operations that users perform in a project. You can apply filters to help you to search the logs.

## Prerequisites

Log in to Harbor with a Harbor administrator, project administrator, master, developer, or guest account.

## Procedure

1. Select **Projects**, select your project, and select the **Logs** tab.

    In the **Logs** view you can see system logs for all of the events that have occurred in the project.
1. To see a reduced list of operations, enter text in the search box.

    For example, enter the name of a repository or a user to see events that apply to that repository or user.
1. If your project has a lot of events, click **Advanced** to refine your search.

   - To search by operation type, click **Operations** and select or deselect **Pull**, **Push**, **Create**, **Delete**, or **Others**.
   - To search for events within a certain time period, click the calendar icons and set dates to search between.
