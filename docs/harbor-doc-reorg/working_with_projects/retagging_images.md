# Retagging Images

Images retag helps users to tag images in Harbor, images can be tagged to  different repositories and projects, as long as the users have sufficient permissions. For example,

```
release/app:stg  -->  release/app:prd
develop/app:v1.0 --> release/app:v1.0
```
To retag an image, users should have read permission (guest role or above) to the source project and write permission (developer role or above) to the target project.

In Harbor portal, select the image you'd like to retag, and click the enabled `Retag` button to open the retag dialog.

![retag image](../img/retag_image.png)

In the retag dialog, project name, repository name and the new tag should be specified. On click the `CONFIRM` button, the new tag would be created instantly. You can check the new tag in the corresponding project.
