# Scan All Images

In the **'Vulnerability'** tab of **'Configuration'** section under **'Administration'**, click on the **'SCAN NOW'** button to start the analysis process for all the existing images. 

**NOTES: The scanning process is executed via multiple concurrent asynchronous tasks. There is no guarantee on the order of scanning or the returned results.**

To avoid frequently triggering the resource intensive scanning process, the availability of the button is restricted. It can be only triggered once in a predefined period. The next available time will be displayed besides the button.
